    Why give a talk?
  </h3>

  <p class="span10 offset1">
    We'd love to have you talk here in Buffalo for our first Ruby conference. We'll be accepting talks through May 15th. Even if this would be for first presentation in front of an audience, we hope that you will apply to speak and share your story!

    Talk Format
  </h3>

  <p class="span10 offset1">
