      Why give a talk?
    </h3>

    <p class="span10 offset1">
      We'd love to have you talk here in Buffalo for our first Ruby conference. We'll be accepting talks through June 9th. Talks don't have to be technical in order to be considered. Even if this would be for first presentation in front of an audience, we hope that you will apply to speak and share your story!
    </p>
    <p class="span10 offset1">
      You don't have to be the expert to have an interesting story to share. There are many techniques and ways to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bipuldeb/seven-deadly-tricks-seven-ways-to-storytelling">tell your story</a>. Please don't hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:nickelcityruby@gmail.com">the organizers</a> if you want feedback or have questions!</a>
    </p>

    <h3 class="span10 offset1">
      What's the format?
    </h3>

    <p class="span10 offset1">
      Talks will be 30 minutes, with a Q&amp;A session after. There will be a short break in between talks. Talks will be recorded (given speaker authorization) and made freely available online when they are ready.
    </p>
    <p class="span10 offset1">
      All speakers and their talks are expected to follow our <a href="https://github.com/nickelcityruby/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 class="span10 offset1">
      How will speakers be chosen?
    </h3>

    <p class="span10 offset1">
      Speakers will be chosen using blind picking (hiding any information distinguishing the speaker) made up of a small, diverse committee.
    </p>

    <h3 class="span10 offset1">
      What will speakers get?
    </h3>

    <p class="span10 offset1">
      You'll get free access to the conference, and our eternal gratitude. We're sorry, but NickelCityRuby can't pay for travel expenses this year.
    </p>

    <h3 class="span10 offset1">
      When will I find out if my talk is accepted?
    </h3>

    <p class="span10 offset1">
      We will contact all those applied by 6/16. Please make sure to include a valid email so that we can get a hold of you with further details.
    </p>
